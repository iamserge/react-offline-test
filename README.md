# React Offline Test from Serge 

Please find complete task as requested - no unicorn's rainbow puke this time, kept it simple. Requested answers to the questions below


# Have you worked in an Agile environment before? If so, what do you consider the most important facet of the Agile approach?

I have worked in an Agile environment for the last 4-5 years, with various teams and on different projects. Also, held the role of the Scrum Master for some time ( while being a developer ). 

In my opinion, the main point about agile is communication and ownership. Team members take responsibility, both individually and as a team, for a piece of work they commit to, and communicate thoroughly between each other and other stakeholders in order to complete the task. 

But a lot of times focus goes on a process itself, endless meetings and Scrum for the sake of Scrum, which results in a false perception of the progress.

# Have you worked in a pair programming environment before? If so, what are the pros and cons of pair programming?

Being completely honest, I haven't, not at least in an official commercial format. But during my career, there have been times when forces had to be joined in order to finish a task, and probably that was a pair programming. 

As for pros, obviously easier to find a solution when you have two pairs of eyes on a code, but I also think that there is an element of competitiveness that exists when two developers are working at the same time on the same problem, which increases productivity.

Cons wise, sometimes there can be multiple correct solutions to one problem, and clash can happen, but I would imagine, it rarely would get into conflict state, so hard a disadvantage.


# What feedback can you give us about the coding exercise?

Only small thing would be to have it pre-configured for SASS, but that is more of a personal preference. Other than that - was a pleasure to work on it.
